    <p>Venezuela or Colombia? Panama or Peru? No, it is not a bet or a soccer team match in the World Cup… We are looking for the origin of the arepas.
        That which is more than a staple of a community; it is a symbol of identity. Something like our potato omelette or calamari sandwich.</p>
    <p>Although there has been a lot of controversy about where the arepas were born, the truth is that we all know that they come from Latin America and that their origin goes back further than 1539:</p>
    <p><i>«They make another kind of bread with the corn as tortillas, about a finger thick, round and big like a French plate, or more or less, and they put them to cook in a pan over the fire, spreading it with fat so that they do not stick, turning them over until they are cooked on both sides and this class is called arepas and some fecteguas.»</i></p>
    <p>This is the oldest reference to the arepa that we can find. Galeotto Cei wrote it in his “Voyage and description of the Indies (1539-1553)”.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Precooked Cornmeal (most recommended, P.A.N)</li>
        <li>Lukewarm Water</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add lukewarm water into a large bowl</li>
        <li>Slowly add the cornmeal, no more that a fist at a time, to the water</li>
        <li>Stir the mix thoroughly making sure there are no lumps</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the whole cornmeal has been mixed with the water</li>
        <li>Divide the mixture into small tennis balls. Then press and give them a circular form</li>
        <li>Put each arepa in a hot grill for 7 minutes, then continue to change sides every 7 minutes until they're crisp on both sides</li>
        <li>It may take between 21 and 28 minutes</li>
        <li>Now it's time to eat!</li>
        <li>Make a cross cut and add any filling: cheese, ham, avocados, scrambled eggs, onion, tomato, vegetables..</li>
    </ol>
